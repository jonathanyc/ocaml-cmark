# cmarker

This is Pablo's fork of [ocaml-cmark][1], originally by Jonathan Chan. I [had
need of the `unsafe` flag][4] for my [static site generator][5], and hadn't
heard back, so I forked it. I may expand to include functions for "examining,
modifying, and iterating over node data" which the original README says
"shouldn't be hard to do, just tedious."

Since I'm not officially a new maintainer, I'm calling this one `cmarker` until
I hear back ðŸ˜›

# Differences

* Builds with [Dune][2], formats with [ocamlformat][6], because it's what I know.
* Includes the Unsafe flag for parsing, since I need it for my blog.

Many thanks to jyc for the initial version.
